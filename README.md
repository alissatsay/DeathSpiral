# DeathSpiral
This project utilizes Processing to create a short animation of a mesmerizing natural phenomenon called Death Spiral. It occurs when one ant gets lost, and in an attempt to find a path back to an anthill finds only his own path and follows it in circles. The rest of the ants end up following the first one, and eventually they all die of exhaustion.
